Creating Sport, Team, Player classes
Create a Array of Strings for each class
HM<String uniqueID, HM<String,String>>

Main:
created 3 static ArrayLists for player, team, sport
created a static hashmap of <String, HM<String,String>>

void create_table(String name, String[] args, string[] pk)
{
  HM<String, String>
  _.put(_,_);
}

void Insert(String[] a, Object o)
{
  for(i = 0 ; i < a.size() ; i++)
  {
  }
}

void Show(HM<String, HM<>) 
{
  for(Entry<S,S> ; h.EntrySet())
  {
   System.out.println(temp.getKey() + temp.getValue());
  }


Player:
void Show()
